Project Description:
A music visualizer app that loops through changing scenes populated by dancers of varying race and gender.

The original version takes input from your computers microphone. The sound from the microphone will alter the yellow bars in front of the camera.

How to Play:
1) Drag the Setup file onto your desktop and double-click to begin the install process. Follow the on-screen instructions.

2) Click on the icon of the installed application to begin. The application will loop infinitely.

3) Press the ESC button to bring up the pause option screen. Here you can exit the application. And check sound input.

Troubleshooting Sound Input:
1) If there is no change occuring in the yellow bars in front of the camera and no sound playing the program may have an issue finding your microphone input.

2) Press the ESC button to bring up the pause option menu to check if "Sound Input: Microphone" is displayed.

3) If "Sound Input: Microphone" is displayed but there is no sound input then the program cannot access your microphone for some reason. In this case, you can install the backup application I created: "Music Runner - No Mic".

4) "Music Runner - No Mic" does not take input from a microphone and instead loops an included song that animates the yellow bars. Mute the volume of your laptop and the application will appear to be fully animated.
